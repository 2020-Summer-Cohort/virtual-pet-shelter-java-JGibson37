# Virtual Pet Shelter
In the Virtual Pet Shelter you are a shelter employee caring for the animals. You may feed them, give them water, play
with them, adopt them out, and accept new arrivals to the shelter. I started the project by using TDD to create my 
methods in VirtualPet. I moved away from TDD as i got further into the project so as not to confuse myself more with
new concepts. I simply went down the list of requirements for each class and coded them in that order. While creating 
my App class I wound up going back to my shelter and adding new methods to be able to perform the requirements of the
App class. Lastly I worked on formatting my output simply, and providing good spacing for readability. Yeehaw!
